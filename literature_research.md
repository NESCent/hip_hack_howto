### The idea, vaguely put
It might be interesting to look at various hackathon proceedings, at the papers that cite these proceedings, and the 
other papers written by the co-authors of the proceedings. For example, if a hackathon catalyzed a new project, then
there might be a follow up paper. What was the impact of that? Another example, did co-authors on the proceedings 
subsequently published more things together?
