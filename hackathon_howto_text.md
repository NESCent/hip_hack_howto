* Expertise can be overrated as a selection criterion

Need a timeline of the whole process: if the hackathon starts at day 0, T-minus X months/weeks for the advertising, T-minus Y months/weeks for the deadline, etc.

* For Phylotastic 2, Advertising was Oct 31 (-3 months), Deadline was Nov 16 (-2.5 months), invitations were (-2 months)

#Pre-Hackathon Activities

##Advertising for Participants
Two basic models: invitation and open call (or a mix of both). The pros of the invitation model is that you ensure that you have the right expertise, you can better control diversity by careful invitation. The cons are that you necessarily restrict participation to those you know to invite, which may be a biased pool. The pros of the open call are that you potentially hit a wider audience, people who you may not have known of or considered; also shows a direct interest in engaging the community. The cons are that you may end up missing necessary expertise. You may find a lack of diversity in applicants. You may not get enough applicants.

Generally, we have used a mixed model, where we target invitations to people who have particular expertise and as a means of increasing diversity, but always including an open application process to try go find broader members of the community who we may have missed. One needs to be careful in this model because if you target too many people with direct invitations, there may not be enough space for those responding to the open call. Generally, if you directly invite someone it’s hard to later not accept them.

Direct invitation is a powerful means of helping to improve diversity. Beyond directly targeting “minorities” (inc. women) for participation, you can target them as mentors who may have students, postdocs, or colleagues that they can suggest as participants. 

Our advertising has been predominantly through popular mailing lists in the appropriate academic discipline, as well as spreading word through emails to colleagues. Generally the first call for applications would go out about 3 weeks before the deadline, with a second call/reminder at 1 week. Direct invitations would go out at the time of the first call, but additional ones can be sent later as other names/suggestions come in.

##The Application Process
We have used a fairly simple application form (through Google Docs) for screening participants (Figure/Appendix X). Beyond obvious fields such as name and contact info, we were interested in the following major fields: (1) availability: can the person attend the entire event; (2) a general checklist of skills/expertise that were applicable to the hackathon theme; (3) personal goal for attending the hackathon: why do they want to attend and what do they want to get from it; (4) demographics. (Lesson learned: we did not ask for demographic info in earlier applications, but found that diversity suffered when we didn’t have information to help balance decisions); (5) where they are coming from (for budgeting purposes) and whether they have support to attend without our funding.

At one point we asked for proof of expertise, but it was a bit awkward and didn’t work very well. 

##Criteria for Choosing Participants
Choosing participants for a hackathon is more complicated than simply choosing expert programmers. A number of criteria need to be considered in trying to optimize productivity. These include (1) the ability to work with others. Some people may be great at working alone, but unable to work in a group setting, which makes them a poor choice for such a group project. (2) Balancing coders and users. Having people who will be using the product working directly with the people who are writing them can help each side better understand how the two halves go together: coders can learn about the way users will want to use a product and the ways in which they’ll be capable of using it (interface), while users will learn more about what is feasible for a product. (3) Diversity: if one of the main goals of a hackathon is to increase the community engagement in a product, system, or concept, it is important to recruit from the broader representative community. This is not always easy. In a general call for applications, one often finds that those who view themselves on the fringes of the “hacker” community will not apply or feel that they cannot contribute, so effort needs to be made to directly encourage and/or invite them. 

Want to invite people who will be motivated, who will gain long-term advantage of the experience. 

Generally, it is often good to mix participants of different career stages because it increases networking and community much more so than a hackathon of all experienced people. You want to mix newcomers with those who’ve been around, to increase community size. One draw of a hackathon to younger participants may be the opportunity to interact with established researchers and programmers. When one is concerned about tangible products as part of the outcome (defined earlier), a balance of career stages may be of particular importance. Younger participants whose future career and job success may be more dependent on tangible outputs will be more motivated to continue with and finish projects after the hackathon has ended; senior participants for whom the output is more of a bonus than a necessity are more likely to fail to find them time in their busy schedules and let projects go fallow (note: there is evidence of this for working groups...should apply to hackathons as well). Our experience is predominantly with hackathons in academic settings, but our hackathons have been a mix of faculty, postdocs, students, and research staff. Research staff generally have greater limitations on post-hackathon time commitments and thus will be less likely to be able to commit after the hackathon is over; related to the earlier point, they are also less likely to generate a career benefit from a product.

Diversity includes gender, ethnicity, experience, and research discipline.

Generally, we have found that the entire leadership team does not have to participate in individual hackathons. 

##Process for Choosing Participants
Applications were divided among leadership team members in a staggered fashion such that each applicant was reviewed by three different people. Applications were scored on a 3 point scale (3 = top, 2 = solid, 1 = poor; half point intervals sometimes used), based on the criteria described above, with a textual explanation for the ranking. Applicants were then ranked from high to low, and a conference call used to choose participants. The ranking was used as a general guide, but not as an absolute decision making criterion, in order to allow the leadership team to best balance the needs of expertise, experience, and diversity. Alternates were identified in case slots opened up after invitations were extended. 

##Pre-hackathon Engagement
We’ve tried to do this using mailing lists, github discussions, etc. Generally, there has not been much success in getting people to engage prior to the hackathon. (The following is a guess). Those who do engage prior to the hackathon are likely to engage during so; little can be predicted about the during-hackathon-engagement of those who do not engage prior to the hackathon, however.

#During the Hackathon

##Schedule and Structure
**Day 1:** The first day of the hackathon is the most unique in structure, because it serves to create the process that will carry through the remaining days. The first activity in the morning is usually a brief introduction by the organizers, followed by very brief introductions from all the participants (who you are, why you’re there). This was generally followed by a series of technical presentations (“boot camps”), where key technologies or concepts important to the overall planned scope of the project, are introduced. These presentations may be from the leadership team, or may be from participants with particular expertise (arranged in advance). (Note: the timing of these presentations can vary quite a bit; sometimes they are before pitches, sometimes afterwards, sometimes they are optional sessions run simultaneously with work projects on other days. Which scenario works best depends a lot on the nature of the presentations and who will most benefit from them).

The next major activity is an open brain-storming session where any participant can propose an idea or concept that they think would be interesting to pursue. This is a more general discussion, high-level and less technical. What would we like to do, not how will we do it? 

Following the open brainstorming (and usually with a break or meal in between), is an opportunity for individuals to make specific pitches about the project(s) they would like to work on. Each individual who wants to make a pitch is given a minute or two to explain their idea. Generally, each pitch is assigned a space in the meeting room where brief discussion and assembly will occur. After all pitches are made, the group as a whole are given an opportunity to wander around, discuss pitches more succinctly and specifically, and to generally self-assemble into potential teams. When the self-organization is complete, a re-evaluation of the pitches is made: the focus of some may have shifted as participants joined project ideas, other pitches may have insufficient support to continue, etc. A group evaluation, facilitated by the leadership team, may be important at this stage in order to prevent individual projects from drifting too far off scope, to prevent projects whose feasibility is unrealistic for the time allowed, and to identify potential holes or gaps in the overall structure that might need to be filled. 

At this stage, with primary projects identified and teams self-assembled, the remainder of the day is left for teams to begin planning how they will attack their individual projects.

**Days 2-X:** Most of the rest of the days of the hackathon are spent with teams working on their individual projects, with occasional time taken to reassemble as a group to update progress. These stand-ups are generally meant to be short and, we have found, generally only need to be performed about once per day (to avoid wasting too much time on updates).

At the end of the hackathon, a general assembly to wrap things up, discuss overall progress, future plans, etc.

##Facilities
*Note: this could go into a pre-hackathon planning section, rather than a during hackathon section*

The hackathon requires a single large meeting room, particularly on the first day, where general discussion, introductions, bootcamp activities, and pitches can occur. The room should be large enough not only to seat everyone, but also to allow free movement and clustering during the pitch session. When possible, it is best if the structure of the seating is non-hierarchical; for example, in a smaller group setting, a single large table which only seats a subset of participants, with others arranged around it sets up a social structure which potentially drops participants into two tiers (with one, literally, "at the table"). 

Beyond these full group activities, however, the large room does not have to serve as a primary workspace when the individual projects get going. In fact, smaller separate rooms are often preferred because it allows each individual group to work and discuss without disturbing other groups. Optimally, these rooms should be near enough the primary group room that people can easily check in with other groups, catch up for meals and breaks, group updates, etc.

Generally, computer equipment is not expected to be provided and participants will be working on their own laptops. Because so much of the hackathon activities involve computers, it should be clear and understood that readily available WiFi access and numerous electrical outlets are absolutely necessary.

##Communication Technology
The nature of a hackathon makes heavy use of a variety of communication technologies likely. Experience indicates that the organizers should choose preferred technologies in advance and try to get users to stick with this set. Consistency among participants becomes very important, both for general communication and for archiving. In one hackathon involving remote participants, a particular group was using one communication technology before lunch and then switched, without announcement, to another technology after lunch. Remote participants had no way of knowing this and were left out of discussion until this was discovered. In general, we encourage technologies which are free, open, and multi-platform, although the needs of a particular project may preclude some of these. Major categories of communicaiton technology to consider include:

###Version Control
There are many types of version control available. Among the most popular, and the one we have used in recent years, is Git and Github. SVN is also very popular. An early hackathon used Google Code, but they recently announced this service is being shut down.

###Document Editing
google docs, github docs, etc.

###Communication
google hangout, skype, chats, etc.
