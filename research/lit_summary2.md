* generating excitement [[Mulholland, 2015 #4543]]
* "Sixty percent of the projects from the hacks held in December, February and March have already shipped internally or to Facebook users."  [[Burnham, 2012 #4579]]
* "Mastodon C" prototype chosen for funding after hackathon and the app was being developed further as a start-up company [I think actually the start-up is "agile big data" and is much broader than one app: see http://www.mastodonc.com/]. [[Zapico, 2013 #4550]]

## points about studying or analyzing hackathons
* possible candidate to show the risk of entropy and bit rot when tangible outcomes aren't tracked and recorded explicitly [[Davies, 2014 #4538]]
* structured thinking about how to make hackathons work [[DePasse, 2014 #4507]][[Groen, 2015 #4531]]

* sample survey questions [[Trainer, 2014 #4504]]
* origin and history of hackathons, jams, LAN parties [[Briscoe, 2014 #4581]]
* possible ways to assess intangible impacts (stories of value creation)[[Wenger, 2011 #4526]]

## Miscellaneous
* costs of remote participation (extra time, lossy communication, lack of in-person dynamics like whiteboarding or looking over a shoulder) [[Christopherson, 2013 #4574]]
* tradition in bioinformatics-- see quotation about historical importance [[Moller, 2014 #4512]]
* available online guidance [[McArthur, 2012 #4569; Murby, 2014 #4548]]
* diversity issues 
   * women in tech and CS program freq = 12 %, [[Briscoe, 2014 #4581]]
   * design maker event to attract females by making it about wearables and succeed,  increasing diversity by completely changing what the hackathon is about-- kinda insulting but hey it worked--; seriously, focus on areas of female insterest (cf [[Tsui, 2009 #4586]]) [[Richard, 2015 #4572]]
* the importance of a "trusted hub". [[Souza, 2013 #4573]]
* political perspective on hackathons as manifestations of "entrepreneurial citizenship" in an Indian context. [[Irani, 2015 #4541]]
* the "civic hackathon", which is basically government awarding hackathon projects prize money for outcomes that "deliver services to citizens"  [[Johnson, 2014 #4540]]
