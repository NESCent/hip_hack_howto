* [[Richard, 2015 #4572]]: design maker event to attract females by making it about wearables, succeed; cite this for increasing diversity by completely changing what the hackathon is about is kinda insulting but hey it worked; seriously, focus on areas of female insterest (cf [[Tsui, 2009 #4586]])

* [[Zapico, 2013 #4550]]: Green hackathons; cite this for 1. open to participants with and without technical expertise. 2. "Mastodon C" prototype chosen for funding after hackathon and the app was being developed further as a start-up company [I think actually the start-up is "agile big data" and is much broader than one app: see http://www.mastodonc.com/]. 3. The "social-physical-corporeal aspect of these types of events", building community, briding disciplines, citing Coleman, Moilanen and Pargman
