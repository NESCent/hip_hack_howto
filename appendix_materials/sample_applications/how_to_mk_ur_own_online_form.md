# Using the NESCent hackathon application template

A generic application template can be copied from the following google doc: 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c97_VH30EKxbWXpNZ_Tqb9gX_z-bWiTMIKq4p2PzkhQ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c97_VH30EKxbWXpNZ_Tqb9gX_z-bWiTMIKq4p2PzkhQ)

To use this, go to the URL, then click "create a copy" to make your own version.  The "Form" menu allows you to view or edit the form.  Protect confidential applicant information by keeping the spreadsheet private, shared only with hackathon organizers.
