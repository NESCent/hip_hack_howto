## Phyloinformatics 

* instigator: NESCent informatics
* release date: November, 2006 (evoldir)
* proposal: http://informatics.nescent.org/wiki/Phylohackathon_1/Proposal 
* open call: phyloinformatics_evoldir_opencall.txt
* report: published hackathon report (Lapp, et al, 2007)
* goals statement: from the above proposal, "The goal of the proposed hackathon is to create interfaces (APIs) and implementations in widely used toolkit libraries so that by using those toolkits, researchers and developers of analysis pipelines can effectively execute important evolutionary analysis programs, pass input to those programs, parse their output back into the toolkit's object model, and possibly store the results of that parse for later retrieval.
More specifically, we choose the Bio* framework of toolkits (BioPerl, Biojava, Biopython, Bioruby, Bioprolog), which includes the most widely used programming toolkits in the life sciences in several programming languages. The Bio* framework also already defines BioSQL as its interoperable persistence model and interface for storing objects."
