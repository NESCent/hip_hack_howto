## The NESCent model of hackathons

NESCent Model: Distinctive Characteristics
   *  ~5 days long
     *  Can tackle larger scoped problems that you can't in a shorter amount of time
     * More likely to achieve the goal of interoperability (and sustaining it)
       * Allows harder, more complex discussions to happen to enable new solutions and bring solutions together
     * Community engagement, discussion, and participation afterward is more likely (builds community cohesion)
     * Longer than 5 is exhaustive and challenging
   * Scope
     * Scope not left to participants; participants know the scope before hand
     * Specific objectives
       * Balanced to ensure cohesiveness while not being too specific (give the right amount of structure)

Also "unique" (may not necessarily be distinct):
 * 1st Day
   * 1st day is well structured
   * [describe 1st day structure]
 * Leadership team (need more discussion - doesn't stand out)
   * Aim to spread the work and ensuring the decision making will be well informed by having different perspectives
   * Set up a process so decision making is done well with informed deliberation
     * What composition of the leadership team facilitates this?
 * Diversity
   * More diverse tend to be more creative and more impactful products 
   * Recruitment: Open call
     * Biggest challenge is getting a diverse applicant pool (no diversity in applicants, no diversity in participants)
     * Tried to increase diversity by expanding outreach (using networks/connections, social media)
       * Didn't work/not effective
     * Tried to tweak message to make it more welcoming to broader audiences
       * Didn't work
     * Approaching people directly in addition to an open call
