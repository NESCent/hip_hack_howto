All of the etherpads from the HIP 5th working group meeting. Mozilla does not guarantee long-term hosting of content on the etherpads. 

The bash script 'get_etherpads.sh' takes a file name, finds links to mozilla-hosted etherpads and downloads them using curl. The file list_of_etherpads is the section at the top of the day 1 etherpad with links to all of the other documentation.
