## Howto docs on hackathons 

I stumbled on some pages with links to multiple hackathon how-to documents (e.g., [this](http://www.hackathonwatch.com/pages/how)). 

I appreciated the distinction made [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/sungardas/2014/03/14/how-to-run-a-winning-hackathon/) between 3 different kinds of hackathons: 

* **Community hackathons** typically gather programmers using specific languages or tools, such as Python or Ruby on Rails. Participants come to meet new people, learn, compete and have fun, so they typically work on whatever they want to.
* **Corporate hackathons** bring together outside developers specifically to work with a company’s code, APIs or products.
* **Internal hackathons** invite company employees to spread their creative wings and interact with colleagues in new ways.

The hackathons described in most documents are 1-day corporate hackathons.  They are often held in large cities where they can attract local talent for free.   They can be very cheap to run because nothing is provided other than space, internet and food.  There is often a judged competition for best projects.   The corporate model is like the recent OpenTree hackathon in the sense of being sponsored by some organization that has a resource or an API that they want to showcase, and the hackathon allows them to generate involvement and interest within a community even when they don’t get a lot of tangible products.  

In the case of an internal hackathon, you already have the talent locally.  You just need to give them time off of their regular projects.  See [a nice little piece on an internal hackathons](https://www.aerofs.com/blog/how-we-run-hackathons/). 

In spite of the differences some of the issues are the same, e.g., as in [this guidance on expectations](http://blog.challengepost.com/post/75049524497/how-to-throw-the-perfect-hackathon-part-ii).  One [reflection on hackathons from the Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2012/6/26/Four-ideas-for-future-hack-thon/) says something familiar: 
> Too rarely have the good app ideas started through these sessions been taken across the finish line and sustained after the weekend has ended.  And, too many of the leanings and too much of the code from these sessions is forgotten or not shared with a broader audience.

Our hackathons are more like community hackathons, more like what is described in the [Open Data hackathon guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fBuisDTIiBAz9u2tr7sgv6GdDLOV_aHbafjqHXSkNB0/edit?pli=1), although that is also describing a 1-day event.
