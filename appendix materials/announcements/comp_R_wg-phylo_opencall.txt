Hi all,

some of you may have been aware already that NESCent is organizing  
its second hackathon, this time on Comparative Methods in the R  
statistical analysis platform. The website for the event is http:// 
hackathon.nescent.org/R_Hackathon_1.

FYI, we are imminent to open a Call for Participation, linked from  
the hackathon website. You will probably see the call come through on  
EvolDir (and a couple of other channels) tonight or tomorrow, but if  
you are interested and haven't been contacted by us yet, please don't  
hesitate to respond to the call right away. The same goes for  
forwarding to a colleague of yours who might be interested.

	-hilmar
