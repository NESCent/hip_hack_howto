# README file for samples of open calls 

This directory contains the "open call" messages used to advertise the hackathon events.  For the first hackathon, where participation was by invitation only, the "open call" was more of a request for comment, with a final sentence instructing people who wanted to participate to contact the organizers.    

## Methods 

These open calls were obtained from 2 mailing lists.  The wg-phyloinformatics mailing list (wg-phyloinformatics@nescent.org) was created for the first hackathon and maintained ever since.  The yearly digest from 2006 to 2015 was downloaded and searched for subsequent hackathon announcements.  If no announcement could be found, we searched instead in the archives of the most widely used evolution mailing list, evoldir (evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA).  Announcements were copied and pasted into a stand-alone text documents referenced below by filename.
