## The NESCent Hackathon Model

The NESCent Model for hackathons distinguishes itself in certain
salient characteristics from the many other models being
practiced. These characteristics are motivated by two foundational
objectives: one, to allow tackling the often difficult problems of
making existing tools and resources work together more seamlessly; and
two, to foster sustained, cohesive communities of practice.

The distinguishing characteristics designed to accomplish these
objectives can be reduced to a combination of the following three.

1. **A participant group that balances diversity with homogenity, and
   that is about 20-30 people in size.** The idea is a group small and
   homogeneous enough in size and composition that every participant
   will still interact with everyone else in at least a meaningful
   social capacity, yet large enough to allow for diversity in a
   variety of aspects, including perspectives, skills, career stage,
   field of study, and demographics.

2. **A well-defined scope that everyone buys into by virtue of
   participating.** Such a definition gives functional as well as
   technological targets. It is also balanced between open enough to
   allow for emergent outcomes, and specific enough to define the
   event by requiring, and thus signifying buy-in from prospective
   participants to shared goals and desired outcomes.

3. **A duration of 4.5-5 days.** This has shown to be still short enough
   to not preclude people from participating who are otherwise well
   suited for an event. It is also long enough to allow participants
   to attempt solutions to data and software interoperability issues,
   which are often challenging yet become tractable with the right set
   of collaborators in the room. And it is long enough to allow ample
   room for participant bonding over common obstacles and shared
   goals, which is key to fostering and sustaining community
   growth and cohesion.

We have used this model exclusively for hackathons in academia, for
bringing together academic research projects, and to foster
communities of practice that consist largely of scientists and
research staff. The model is potentially well applicable to non-profit
and government settings as well, but in the industry realm in
particular the duration will prevent most people from participating.

NESCent Model: Distinctive Characteristics
 ~5 days long
 Can tackle larger scoped problems that you can't in a shorter amount of time
More likely to achieve the goal of interoperability (and sustaining it)
Allows harder, more complex discussions to happen to enable new solutions and bring solutions together
Community engagement, discussion, and participation afterward is more likely (builds community cohesion)
Longer than 5 is exhaustive and challenging
Scope
Scope not left to participants; participants know the scope before hand
Specific objectives


Also "unique" (may not necessarily be distinct):
1st Day
1st day is well structured
[describe 1st day structure]
Leadership team (need more discussion - doesn't stand out)
Aim to spread the work and ensuring the decision making will be well informed by having different perspectives
Set up a process so decision making is done well with informed deliberation
What composition of the leadership team facilitates this?
Diversity
More diverse tend to be more creative and more impactful products 
Recruitment: Open call
Biggest challenge is getting a diverse applicant pool (no diversity in applicants, no diversity in participants)
Tried to increase diversity by expanding outreach (using networks/connections, social media)
Didn't work/not effective
Tried to tweak message to make it more welcoming to broader audiences
Didn't work
Approaching people directly in addition to an open call
