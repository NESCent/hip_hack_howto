# Possible places to publish articles on our hackathon analysis

## [Scientific Data](http://www.nature.com/sdata/)

Could be used to publish a dataset based on surveys, analysis of commits etc. from the series of hackathons? NESCent has [already published a set of somewhat unusual datasets with them](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201430) - indeed, I was chatting with Andrew Hufton, managing editor of the journal, just last week, he says "Hi" to Karen :)

## [PLoS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/)

### [Ten Simple Rules collection](http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v03.i01)

Could be used for an anecdotal-focused but maybe backed-up-by-data article - we have one in here recently on [organising unconferences](http://journals.plos.org/ploscollections/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003905)

### "Simple guide" in the [education collection](http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v03.i02)

Similar to the "Ten simple rules" approach but with a bit more flexibility e.g. we just did one on organising successful [bioinformatics communities](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003972)

## [F1000 Research](http://f1000research.com/)

They have a specific interest in soliciting "[science communication](http://blog.f1000research.com/2014/01/20/publishing-science-communication-papers-in-f1000research-free-in-2014/)" articles.

## PLoS Biology "Community page"

To quote from [here](http://www.plosbiology.org/static/descriptions):

> The Community Page is a forum for organizations and societies to highlight their efforts to enhance the dissemination and value of scientific knowledge.

Here's are two examples of articles of this kind:

- [microBEnet: Lessons Learned from Building an Interdisciplinary Scientific Community in the Online Sphere](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001884)
- [COMPASS: Navigating the Rules of Scientific Engagement](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001552)
- [A Wee Lesson in Science Communication](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020122)

(I can't find anyway to easily get a list of all they've published of that kind, hence putting some examples above)

## BMC Bioinformatics

Previous articles related to this topic i.e. [Phylotastic! Making tree-of-life knowledge accessible, reusable and convenient.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/158) and  [Community-driven development for computational biology at Sprints, Hackathons and Codefests.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/S14/S7) have gone there.
