# NESCent Hackathons - lessons learnt

## Thursday 12th - Sunday 15th March 2015

### Aims

To produce material that we can share with the world, that will help organisers of future similar events:

- organise more effective events, and to do this more efficiently i.e. with less time and/or effort
- lobby funders to provide resources to organise such events

### Thursday 12th March

My (Aidan's) aims with this first morning session are to help us:

- "break the ice" i.e. help us all get to know each other, and set a collaborative, friendly mood for the rest of the meeting
- check we have aligned goals and intended outcomes for our 4 days together; if not, or there's uncertainty, to discuss and agree on some
- explore a wide range of possible activities we could carry out to achieve our aims, with particular focus on what we can achieve during the 4 days

Some of the above is already worked on during our pre-course hangouts, but doing this is person may help develop all these things further, which may help us in spotting opportunities we didn't yet touch on.

#### Welcome and introduction to the event

Probably best coming from Arlin.

#### Personal introductions

Let's vote on which of the two following options we use for introducing ourselves:

##### Option 1: Speed-dating

We'll be 8 people (as I think Rutger - or someone else - arrives in the afternoon, at which point we'll be 9) which fits the [approach described here](http://figshare.com/articles/Why_participate_in_a_course_Speed_dating_introduction_activity_/1145610) well, as it works best (i.e. with no one ever standing around without someone to talk to) with square numbers. We'll do 3 minutes per chat, so we'll allow 25 minutes for the session. (If we're 7, then one person is always standing silently - but then that person can be the one counting the next 3 minutes down for us!)

Aim is to generally wake us all up, promote an interactive/collaborative approach for the rest of the day,  making sure that everyone at the meeting has a chance to directly greet each other. This is most useful for people who know few people at the meeting, but experience indicates that even those who already know most others enjoy the chance for a chat with those they already know.

##### Option 2: "Classic" introductions

One at a time, each person stands up and describes their current job and their reason for being interested in joining the meeting

#### Clarifying goals, intended outcomes, program structure, activities etc.

Let's vote on which of the following activities we do, and in what order (we can change our mind as we go along). My suggestion would be:

- 45 - 60 min of Lean Coffee to start us off exploring, very free-form, what we're interested in doing together, any pressing issues not yet discussed in what we percieve as enough detail
- 60 min Project Point of Departure for us to draw up together and agree on a set of important features of the meeting (outcomes, goals, possible activities etc.)
- 60 min of either/or/both Open Space Technology to start putting together ideas for specific projects, or more Lean Coffee, to identify the initial groups/teams and their goals for the work of the rest of the day

i.e. leaving out the brainswarming as I have my doubts of it being useful in this context.

#### [Lean Coffee](http://de.slideshare.net/SteveRogalsky/a-guide-to-lean-coffee) 

A meeting format that helps focus discussion on those topics of interest shared by the majority of a group, and to regulate the amount of time spend discussing each topic so that it fits the interest/attention span of the majority of the group. [This link](http://de.slideshare.net/SteveRogalsky/a-guide-to-lean-coffee) describes it in a bit more detail.

Could be good to have a volunteer to take minutes during the session, ideally taken online (GoogleDoc, Etherpad?), and to take a photo of the post-it notes used for voting at the end of the session.

If we find the format useful, we might like to try starting each day with one.

Could help us spot/catch any common discussion topics of interest, and give us a chance to discuss them all together, that somehow weren't covered during meeting preparations.

#### [Project Point of Departure](http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/project-point-of-departure)

This is not much more (indeed, if I understand, it is nothing more) than us running together through a list of issues/questions where we try to agree, in a short time, on a common answer to them. We could give 10 minutes (maximum) to each of the topics listed below?

The text below is largely quoted from this "Hyper Island" description of the activity, with a bit of editing:

***Purpose***: What is the overall purpose of the project? (express this in one sentence)

***Desired Outcome***: What specific outcomes should be achieved by the end of the project? (aim for 2-4 bullets)

***Target Group & Value***: Who are you doing the project for? And what value does it provide to those people? (aim for 3 bullets or less)

***Milestones & Budget***: What needs to happen by when? And how much money do you have? (broken down into bullet points, on a broad level)

***How***: How will the team work together, how will you communicate, divide tasks, collaborate, approach decision making, etc. (try to define about 5 guidelines with short descriptions for each)

***Success / Fiasco Criterias***: What do success look like? What does failure look like? (aim for 4-5 bullet point for each one)

***Connections***: What projects are connected to this one? Are there any other documents or data sources that we need to take into account? (list the connections with hyperlinks to key documents)

#### BrainSwarming

BrainSwarming is an approach to generating a set of possible solutions to a problem that is a response to acknowledged inefficiencies of brainstorming. It also produces a map/network of a groups ideas about addressing a question or problem that can be useful documentation for future discussion, without time being spent organising and transcribing the results of a discussion.

Here's a [page on Harvard Buisness Review](http://99u.com/workbook/24273/stop-brainstorming-start-brainswarming) with a video embedded that describes the process and the rationale. And here's a [more detailed description of it on BrainPlay.](http://brainplay.wikia.com/wiki/Brainswarming)

I've (Aidan) never tried it, but had thought it could be interesting. However I've tried it out with several gruops since proposing it last week, working with similarly abstract kinds of problems, and it clearly works best with "simple", "physical" problems/goals, things that have "solutions". They also need to be fairly focused - possible ideas could be:

- "Help others deliver more effective efficient 'community' hackathons"
- "Sharing what we learnt from our hackathons with the world"
- "Building towards quantitative analysis of benefits/impact and successful features of hackathons"

But even just choosing a "good" topic is difficult

#### Pitch the sub-projects

Just a list of possible proejcts for us to attempt during the four days, to keep in mind/reserve for the discussions:

- literature survey (peer-reviewed, and otherwise as is seen as particularly useful) of hackathons, including classification/categorisation into different types/styles of hackathon
- description of the organisation and logistics of a typical NESCent hackathon
- analysis of Twitter networks before/during/after the events (who follows whom, who mentions whom)
- variation in usage of github (in general, for specific projects/software) before/during/after the hackathon
- choosing list of anecdote-based-and-supported guidelines for running a successful hackathon of this kind (begin choosing guidelines, as a group/crowd, then start drafting the descriptions of each of them)
- creating a list of hypotheses one might be interested in testing using data collected about hackathon participants and attempts to measure success of a hackathon
    - follow-up to this would be specifying data you could use to address these questions, describing possible structures for this, if possible use some of data we already have to attempt to answer some of them
- preparing a set of documents for potential re-use by future organisers
    - logistics check-list
    - application forms
    - feedback questionnaires
    - surveys
    - etc.

#### Open Space Technology

This approach [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) gives a way for us to identify the projects we most want to get done during the four days, with us voting with our feet etc.
