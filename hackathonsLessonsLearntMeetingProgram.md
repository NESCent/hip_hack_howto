# NESCent Hackathons - lessons learnt

## Thursday 12th - Sunday 15th March 2015

### Aims

To produce material that we can share with the world, that will help organisers of future similar events:

- organise more effective events, and to do this more efficiently i.e. with less time and/or effort
- lobby funders to provide resources to organise such events

### Program

#### Welcome and introduction to the event

#### Personal introductions

Something other than one at a time introduce ourselves? e.g.

Small group, but could try speed-dating i.e. 1:1 chats 2-min each, everyone meets everyone?

...?

#### Lean Coffee for an hour

A meeting format that helps focus discussion on those topics of interest shared across the group, and to crowd-control the amount of time spend discussing each topic. URL

Could help us spot/catch any common discussion topics of interest, and give us a chance to discuss them all together, that somehow weren't covered during meeting preparations.

#### Pitch the sub-projects

Possible sub-projects could include:

- literature survey (peer-reviewed, and otherwise as is seen as particularly useful) of hackathons, including classification/categorisation into different types/styles of hackathon
- description of the organisation and logistics of a typical NESCent hackathon
- analysis of Twitter networks before/during/after the events (who follows whom, who mentions whom)
- variation in usage of github (in general, for specific projects/software) before/during/after the hackathon
- choosing list of anecdote-based-and-supported guidelines for running a successful hackathon of this kind (begin choosing guidelines, as a group/crowd, then start drafting the descriptions of each of them)
- creating a list of hypotheses one might be interested in testing using data collected about hackathon participants and attempts to measure success of a hackathon
    - follow-up to this would be specifying data you could use to address these questions, describing possible structures for this, if possible use some of data we already have to attempt to answer some of them
- preparing a set of documents for potential re-use by future organisers
    - logistics check-list
    - application forms
    - feedback questionnaires
    - surveys
    - etc.

#### Cluster around pitched sub-projects by interests, start working on them 

Very similar to Open Space Technology approaches URL, people free to move between projects as feels right to them.

#### Regular updates on progress (midday, evening)
