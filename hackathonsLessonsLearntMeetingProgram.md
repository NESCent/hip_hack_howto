# NESCent Hackathons - lessons learnt

## Thursday 12th - Sunday 15th March 2015

### Aims

To produce material that we can share with the world, that will help organisers of future similar events:

- organise more effective events, and to do this more efficiently i.e. with less time and/or effort
- lobby funders to provide resources to organise such events

### Program

#### Welcome and introduction to the event

#### Personal introductions (25 min)

Speed-dating - we'll be 8 people (as I think Rutger - or someone else - arrives in the afternoon, at which point we'll be 9) which fits the [approach described here](http://figshare.com/articles/Why_participate_in_a_course_Speed_dating_introduction_activity_/1145610) well, as it works best (i.e. with noone ever standing around without someone to talk to) with square numbers. We'll do 3 minutes per chat, so we'll allow 25 minutes for the session.

Aim is to generally wake us all up, promote an interactive/collaborative approach for the rest of the day,  making sure that everyone at the meeting has a chance to directly greet each other. This is most useful for people who know few people at the meeting, but experience indicates that even those who already know most others enjoy the chance for a chat with those they already know.

#### [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) for an hour

A meeting format that helps focus discussion on those topics of interest shared across the group, and to crowd-control the amount of time spend discussing each topic. [This link](http://leancoffee.org/) describes it in a bit more detail.

Could help us spot/catch any common discussion topics of interest, and give us a chance to discuss them all together, that somehow weren't covered during meeting preparations.

#### BrainSwarming

BrainSwarming is an approach to generating a set of possible solutions to a problem that is a response to acknowledged problems of brainstorming.

Here's a [page on Harvard Buisness Review](http://99u.com/workbook/24273/stop-brainstorming-start-brainswarming) with a video embedded that describes the process and the rationale.

And here's a [more detailed description of it on BrainPlay](http://brainplay.wikia.com/wiki/Brainswarming)

I've (Aidan) never tried it, but been looking for an opportunity to try it out. Might be fun to try, and we might get something surprising/valuable out of it?

Some ideas for how to start structuring the session could be:

Problem:

- "Help others deliver more effective efficient 'community' hackathons"

Possible approaches to addressing the problem (direct links to the problem):
- Peer-review journal publication based on lessons learned
- Dataset publication
- ...?

More detailed description of carrying out a particular solution (e.g. direct linked to "dataset publication"):

- describe set of hypotheses of interest for testing with current (or possibly future-collected) data
- write scripts to analyse hypothetical data

Resources:

- Survey results
- Available literature
- github logs
- Twitter archives


#### Pitch the sub-projects

Possible sub-projects could include:

- literature survey (peer-reviewed, and otherwise as is seen as particularly useful) of hackathons, including classification/categorisation into different types/styles of hackathon
- description of the organisation and logistics of a typical NESCent hackathon
- analysis of Twitter networks before/during/after the events (who follows whom, who mentions whom)
- variation in usage of github (in general, for specific projects/software) before/during/after the hackathon
- choosing list of anecdote-based-and-supported guidelines for running a successful hackathon of this kind (begin choosing guidelines, as a group/crowd, then start drafting the descriptions of each of them)
- creating a list of hypotheses one might be interested in testing using data collected about hackathon participants and attempts to measure success of a hackathon
    - follow-up to this would be specifying data you could use to address these questions, describing possible structures for this, if possible use some of data we already have to attempt to answer some of them
- preparing a set of documents for potential re-use by future organisers
    - logistics check-list
    - application forms
    - feedback questionnaires
    - surveys
    - etc.

#### Cluster around pitched sub-projects by interests, start working on them 

Very similar to Open Space Technology approaches (the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) on this gives a reasonable, quick intro to the idea), people free to move between projects as feels right to them.

#### Regular updates on progress (midday, evening)
