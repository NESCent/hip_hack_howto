# Meeting notes 



## Hangout, 25 Feb 2015

present: Karen, Shannon, Arlin, Jonathan, Aidan, Mike, Rutger, Enrico

### General sense of the meeting
* We should develop guidance describing our style of hackathons in detail
* But what's really going to make this powerful is evidence-based analysis of impacts and best practices. 
* NEAD is a powerful resource we could use
* We should define our target audience, probably target organizers of hackathons directly (and target sponsors and participants indirectly, by explaining their needs to organizers)
* Make sure to continue thinking about these issues, explore literature and post in github

### blow-by-blow account of discussion
Brief summary from previous call
* Arlin
    * Recruitment Process - part targeted invitations, part open application and selection
    * Develop a precise description of our typical protocol for the events
    * Set a theme/focus
    * Initial presentations and training
    * Q&A sessions 
    * Pitches, propose ideas, post them on the walls, allow people to walk around and discuss
    * Create good set of teams (at least 3, no more than 7)
    * Work on projects, regular reports to the whole group (daily?)
Discussion of the importance of making the analysis evidence based; we have 8 events, 40 projects, we should analyze them and try to generalize some lessons learned
* Arlin
    * Agree on the importance of evdience-based analysis
    * We need to situate our analysis - what makes it different from other reported efforts (e.g., organize opensource communities)
    * Develop guidance to organizers; useful materials for them (e.g., a package for organizers)
* Rutger
    * Evidence based is critical 
    * We should look at the paper trail of the various events and determine the tangible products (publications, proposals)
    * Also, do we want to limit our analysis to our hackathons or include similar scientific ones from other organizations?
    * What makes a group more effective and produce long term impact? What are the factors?
    * For example, one hypothesis is that teams working within an existing code-base are more sustainable than those that work on a standalone development
* Mike 
    * Let us compare criteria that could make a working group successful
    * Hypothesis: Career status and type of jobs are critical factors; people that are young (i.e., in early stage of their academic careers) are more hungry for products and compelled to sustain the effort
    * Type of jobs could also be a factor - e.g., technicians may have lack of drive to continue developments outside of the hackathon
    * Can we go back and analyze the participants status at the time of the event? 
* Aiden
    * we should also look at the type of data that hackathons worked on (see for example http://www.nature.com/sdata/collections/nescent)
    * we could collect data and make it a publishable data set for others to use
* Jonathan
    * Presents stats from a survey of a 2009 hackathon collected 6 months afterwards
    * 24 respondents; produced 2 courses, 5 presentations, 6 proposals, 3 publications, 13 software/data sets
    * Point to NEAD, the NESCent repository; it has precious information we could use; organized by projects
    * http://nescent.org/informatics/products.php
    * http://nescent.org/science/products.php
    * Also, the idea of studying the status of the particants (job placement) is important
    * Another concern: what makes hackathons different from the process of building opensource communities? How do we distinguish from them?
    * May want to see http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=sourceforge to study projects on Sourceforge
* Mike
    * Another thing to consider is that many hackathons reported in the literature are business-related; what makes those distinct from scientific ones? Could that be part of the "situating" our efforts?
* Karen
    * We should think not only about tangible products (papers, proposals, etc.) but also the secondary impact of making the events an entry point for non-technical people; evangelize and train
    * We teach lots of useful skills - github, sharing data, interop technologies, open projects
    * We teach about inclusion and diversity in terams
    * Introduce people to technologies (e.g., Nexml disseminated before any publications)
* Shannon
    * We really need to start our focus from identifying the target audience
    * Probably we are not targeting participants, but organizers
    * People who need to organize an event and/or convince sponsors of the importance
* Rutger
    * It would be great for organizers to have a publication they could refer to in order to support their case (e.g., to convince sponsors about the effectiveness of hackathons)
    * We should tailor our process to this goal
    * It would be nice to show that hackathons have a greater impact than investing in a Symposium or hiring a programmer
* Aiden
    * We should try to assess (e.g., using anecdotes) the impact of community building using hackathons
    * Also, try to see how we could measure how the values of the sponsors can be met through these events
* Enrico
    * Would it be valuable to ask questions to previous participants (we have mailing lists)
    * Could we develop during our meeting surveys that we could circulate to collect additional information?

## Hangout, 17 Feb 2015

present: Karen, Shannon, Arlin, Jonathan, Aidan, Hilmar, Mike 

We began with brief introductions.  Then each person was asked to comment on the general issue of what we hope to accomplish by evaluating past hackathons and providing guidance. 
* Shannon: make hackathons more efficient 
* Mike: address issue of follow-up (projects get dropped when hackathon ends)
* Jonathan: clarify expectations for participants; longer-term impact on community
* Aidan: 
    * we have a lot of time, enough to write a draft 
    * suggests to decide on title and format before starting 
    * suggests to strategize about how to spend our time during meeting 
* Karen: 
    * chance for detailed analysis of what happens to products or teams
    * opportunity to crowd-source writing, involve community 
* Hilmar: 
    * some commercial hackathons are quite different
    * keeping expectations low (flexibility high) attracts talent
    * we have a unique chance to assemble data on impacts 
* Arlin 
    * evaluating impacts is going to be hard work, but worthwhile
    * need to situate our guidance for possible organizers or sponsors 

This was followed by further comments and about 20 minutes of general discussion.  Some of the issues that came up were: 
* understanding how tasks and sub-tasks are decomposed in hackathons
* distinguishing coordination (among teams) from product integration 
* defining "communities"
* what kind of research we can do 
* working backwards from our deliverables to what we need to do 
* Jonathan's results from a survey of hackathon participants 
*
