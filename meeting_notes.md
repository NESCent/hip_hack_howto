# Meeting notes 

## Hangout, 17 Feb 2015

present: Karen, Shannon, Arlin, Jonathan, Aidan, Hilmar, Mike 

We began with brief introductions.  Then each person was asked to comment on the general issue of what we hope to accomplish by evaluating past hackathons and providing guidance. 
* Shannon: make hackathons more efficient 
* Mike: address issue of follow-up (projects get dropped when hackathon ends)
* Jonathan: clarify expectations for participants; longer-term impact on community
* Aidan: 
    * we have a lot of time, enough to write a draft 
    * suggests to decide on title and format before starting 
    * suggests to strategize about how to spend our time during meeting 
* Karen: 
    * chance for detailed analysis of what happens to products or teams
    * opportunity to crowd-source writing, involve community 
* Hilmar: 
    * some commercial hackathons are quite different
    * keeping expectations low (flexibility high) attracts talent
    * we have a unique chance to assemble data on impacts 
* Arlin 
    * evaluating impacts is going to be hard work, but worthwhile
    * need to situate our guidance for possible organizers or sponsors 

This was followed by further comments and about 20 minutes of general discussion.  Some of the issues that came up were: 
* understanding how tasks and sub-tasks are decomposed in hackathons
* distinguishing coordination (among teams) from product integration 
* defining "communities"
* what kind of research we can do 
* working backwards from our deliverables to what we need to do 
* Jonathan's results from a survey of hackathon participants 
*
