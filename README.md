# hip_hack_howto

This repository stores material developed for the "Hackathon Lessons Learned" project of 
the HIP (hackathons, interoperability, phylogenies).  The purpose of the project is to
* document the NESCent model,
* provide evidence of impact (useful for organizers to sell hackathons to sponsors),
* convey lessons learned from our experience, and
* lay a foundation for future research (including a data framework and our suggestions about research methods and questions).

## Overview 

NESCent has sponsored and co-sponsored 10 hackathons since 2006.  Because these events 
have been considered such a success in our community, one of the main goals of the group 
is to publish a guidance document (along with templates for applications, etc) for 
hackathon organizers.  Over the years we have worked out a formula for the crucial process 
of team-and-project formation (using an OpenSpace-like process), as well as for planning, 
recruiting, and logistics.  We know how big the organizing team needs to be, and how much 
time they will require.  We have a diversity strategy that has succeeded in getting 30 to 
40 % women and minority participants at our events.  Nearly all of our hackathons have 
been ~30 people, including pre-selected experts (e.g., representing a targeted project) 
and proficiency-reviewed applicants who responded to an open call.  
 
This is the main repository for our work. We also have a private repository of data, most 
of which will be released upon IRB approval. We welcome comments and suggestions from 
anyone interested.

## Repo organization

* [discussions](discussions/) contains materials related to our discussions about this 
  project. This includes meeting planning, minutes and notes, etherpads, and markdown 
  documents where we think out loud about this project.
* [manuscript](manuscript/) contains drafts of (part of) the manuscript, the figures, and
  the appendix materials. As long as the intent was that this was material that conceivably
  could end up in a manuscript it will be here, however rough and practically unusable.
* [research](research/) contains any materials related to preliminary research and analysis
  for the manuscript.
