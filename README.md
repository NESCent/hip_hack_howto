# hip_hack_howto

This repository stores material developed for the "Hackathon Lessons Learned" project of the HIP (hackathons, interoperability, phylogenies) working group of NESCent.  

NESCent has sponsored and co-sponsored 8 hackathons since 2006.  Because these events have been considered such a success in our community, one of the main goals of the group is to publish a guidance document (along with templates for applications, etc) for hackathon organizers.  Over the years we have worked out a formula for the crucial process of team-and-project formation (using an OpenSpace-like process), as well as for planning, recruiting, and logistics.  We know how big the organizing team needs to be, and how much time they will require.  We have a diversity strategy that has succeeded in getting 30 to 40 % women and minority participants at our events.  Nearly all of our hackathons have been ~30 people, including pre-selected experts (e.g., representing a targeted project) and proficiency-reviewed applicants who responded to an open call.  
 
Our group consists mainly of biological data scientists and programmers who have been involved with organizing and participating in NESCent hackathons, and also includes members representing technical trainers, social scientists, and hackathon participants who are not organizers.

We welcome suggestions from anyone interested.  Use the issue tracker.
