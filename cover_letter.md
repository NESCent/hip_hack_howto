Dear F1000 editors,

We submit for consideration a manuscript entitled "Community and Code: Nine Lessons from Nine NESCent Hackathons". Hackathons (also called codefests) are an increasingly common event type in the computational sciences, yet their impact has not been well-studied.

Over the course of a decade, the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) organized nine different hackathons. We describe the outcomes of the hackathon series, which include both technical and social impacts. The manuscript also describes the NESCent hackathon format and organizational process, and therefore serves as a how-to guide for others thinking of holding a hackathon-style event. Finally, we propose changes to data collection that would help assess the impact of future hackathon events. 

Sincerely,

Arlin Stoltzfus
